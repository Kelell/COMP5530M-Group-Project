# COMP5530M Group Project

## Project Overview 

The aim of this project is to create a Watson Assistant chatbot that will ask the user to list the foods they have access to in their kitchen. Once the user has listed the items, the application will then list the meals that could be made from the available items. This technology can be integrated with Amazonâ€™s Alexia allowing it to be a voice activated, hands free program that can be used without interrupting the cooking process.

## Tasks
1. Set up the repository: Invite all members, set up the wiki, set up project milestones. 
2. Decide on project milestones.
